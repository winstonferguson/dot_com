I integrated AI-driven user interactions to generate input values for a parametric 3D configurator. Built on Rails 7 with Stimulus.js controllers, the application leverages ShapeDiver for cloud-based parametric design. I also developed a user credit system to track AI usage, ensuring efficiency and scalability.
